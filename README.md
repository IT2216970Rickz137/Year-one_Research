# Introduction
<br>

A game is a form of activity played for the general amusement or fun of the interested parties. The desire to play is almost as old as humanity itself and it is vital for the development of children and for the growth or escapism of adults.[1] A video game is a game which is played within digitalized media. A computer game can be referred to as a subset of video games or the games played with the use of a personal computer. History of video games is well recorded thanks to the age of information compared to traditional games or sports. Space wars is generally accepted as the first ever computer game which was made by Stephen Russell (student/ at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1962, which originally ran on a PDP-1 computer.[2] The first commercially available arcade video game, pong, was introduced in 1973 with the Atari.[3] The first home video game console, Magnavox Odyssey, was released in 1972.[4]
